# TSUNDERTALE
Created as homework of summer vacation 

This is the first game I made in Python, inspired by UNDERTALE.
Only Japanese is supported.
When the program starts, a screen will appear displaying the title and the options "はじめる" and "とじる."
Click "はじめる" to begin. Use the arrow keys to control your heart.
Just keep avoiding blaster attacks (white beams). The game is over when your HP reaches 0.
The game is cleared when you reach level 200.
